# Hosting Proposal – `[website]` - `[date]`

## Summary
The Client (`[client]`), located at `[address]` is hiring CodeKnight to set up and manage hosting for `[website]`. This document is bound by and to be read in conjunction with CodeKnight's Hosting Terms and Conditions, which can be found online at [codeknight.co.uk/hosting](http://codeknight.co.uk/hosting). My preferred hosting provider is DigitalOcean.

## Server Specification
Your server will start with the following specifications which will be reviewed yearly.
*  512mb memory
*  1 CPU
*  20GB SSD storage
*  1TB data transfer
If your website exceeds your data transfer limit, the cost of bandwidth is £0.04 per GB over the limit.

## Services
This agreement covers:

*  Setting up your server and DNS settings
*  Installing critical security updates on your server
*  Monitoring your server for downtime and notifying you if any downtime lasts for a significant period of time
*  Weekly backups of your server. Each backup is retained for 4 weeks.

It does not cover:

*  Website content updates
*  Website bug fixes
*  Support requests
*  Any issues relating to your website source code

If you'd like me to update your content, maintain your website source code and provide security updates, please get in touch and I can organise a maintenance retainer.

This agreement does not cover any issues related to email setup, IT support, working with external companies, content updates or any other issues arising from the website itself. Any downtime is the responsibility of the hosting company.

I can't possibly make sure that your site is 100% secure, but if there is a breach then I reserve the right to resolve security issues at a reduced hourly rate. To reduce the risk of security issues, I recommend that you take out a maintenance retainer.

## Payment Terms
Invoices are issued yearly in advance, one month before your hosting is due for renewal. Invoices are due within 14 days via BACS or Stripe. Overdue invoices will result in the hosting being terminated, and your website and related services will go offline. I cannot be held responsible for damages or loss of business as a result of terminated hosting.

## Service Level Agreement & Liability
DigitalOcean provides a 99.99% Uptime SLA for their servers. I will refund any significant amount of lost time at a rate of £0.05 per hour upon request. The Client shall indemnify CodeKnight against all damages, losses and expenses arising as a result of any action or claim relating to website downtime.

## Contact
I will be available for contact between 8am and 6pm UK time, and will respond to all support requests within 24 hours.

## Termination
If at any time, you decide you'd like to cancel this agreement, move your hosting elsewhere or find another developer to carry out work on the site, you may do so by telling me in writing and paying any outstanding invoices. If you'd like to continue using me as a developer but move your hosting elsewhere, I will provide all relevant details to move your site and can provide assistance at my hourly rate.
